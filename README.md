# Manufacturing-Digital-Canvas

This project addresses the previously unknown level of digital solution adoption across our organization's multiple manufacturing plants. Prior to its implementation, we lacked a clear understanding of how each plant utilized these solutions to optimize their production processes.

The newly developed application allows the central team to capture and assess the usage of digital solutions across the organization, assigning a score between 0 and 100 for each solution and finally sending the evaluation report to each responsible management persons through power automate flow with a single click. This evaluation focuses on three key areas:

* Process Impact - Evaluates the degree to which the solution streamlines and improves manufacturing processes.
* People Impact - Assesses the effectiveness of the solution in empowering employees and enhancing their productivity.
* System Infrastructure - Examines the compatibility and integration of the solution with existing IT systems.

Following the initial evaluation round, we now have a comprehensive picture of digital solution adoption across all plants, allowing us to identify areas requiring targeted attention and highlight digitally advanced facilities. Furthermore, a dedicated Power BI dashboard has been created to visualize solution-specific scores for each plant, providing clear insights into individual strengths and weaknesses.

### Benefits:

* Improved visibility - Provides a clear understanding of digital solution usage across all plants.
* Data-driven decision making - Enables informed decisions regarding digital investments and support initiatives.
* Benchmarking - Allows comparison of digital maturity levels between different plants.
* Identification of best practices - Facilitates the sharing of knowledge and successful digital strategies across plants.
* Improved operational efficiency - Supports the optimization of production processes through the effective utilization of digital solutions.

This project has significantly enhanced our understanding of digital solution adoption across our manufacturing plants, laying the foundation for strategic investments and targeted support initiatives to drive further improvements in operational efficiency and overall success.
